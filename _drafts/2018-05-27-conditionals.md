Conditionals

## First conditional
In the first conditional, happen to and should can be used in the if-clause to express that something is possible but not very likely:

* If you happen to see Kate, say hi from me.
* If you should see Kate, say hi from me.

## Second conditional
In the second conditional, we can use were to for unlikelihood:

* If he were to propose to you now, what would you say?

## Third conditional
Here were to + perfect infinitive expresses an imaginary past action which was very unlikely:

* If he were to have asked me, I would have said yes.
