## Overview

A network is a system of computers connected together so that they can share resources and communicate with each other.  Now, networking refers to how the connected computers communicate.

### Java.net Package

Java.net package contains the classes you'll use to establish connections between computers and then send messages between them.

You can also use networking  when you want applications running on the same machine  to communicate with each other. So networking can be involved even when only one  machine is involved. But, let's stop saying machine. When discussing networking, a machine is usually referred to as a **host**.

<figure style="width: 500px" class="align-center">

A common networking configuration  that you've probably heard of is **client/server**,  meaning that one or more hosts on the network  are acting as servers, and the other hosts are clients  that connect to the server.   Now, at a high level, that's how the Internet operates.

<figure style="width: 500px" class="align-center">

The browser is the client, and when you type in a web address, it connects to the server that has the files for the website at that address.  Now, of course, that's overly simplified,  but essentially, that's how the internet works.

<figure style="width: 500px" class="align-center">

Now, as I mentioned, you can have a client/server interaction on the same host.  For example, the MySQL database comes with software  called workbench that you can use  to perform database operations.  So the workbench is the client,  and it connects to the MySQL database server on that local host.  And of course, it could also connect remotely to another server if needed as well.  

Now, another example is local web development.  It's possible to run an apache IIS web server on your computer, and connect to it using a browser on that same computer.  And in fact, that's often what web developers do when they're working on a website for a client.

So, computers on a network, which includes the Internet,  communicate with each other using a transport protocol.  Now, we'll use the TCP and UDP protocols  moving forward in this section

Now generally a computer will have one physical connection to a network, and anything sent to the computer from other hosts on the network will arrive through that connection.  But, sometimes the same computer will be running multiple application that want data from the network.  For example, at any one time you might have a browser open,  a chat application open, and you might be streaming music and so on and so forth.

So when data arrives at the one physical connection to the network, how does it get routed to the target application?  Well that's where ports come in.  Each application that needs data from the network is assigned a port, (this includes clients connecting to a server that's on the same machine).  And when data arrives, the port number is used to route the data for the specific application that's waiting for it.

So every host connected to the Internet  has a unique IP address. Now the four numbers that will come back  are in the form X.X.X.X, or you might also see a series  of eight segments separated by colons.  And that's because there are **IPv4** addresses and **IPv6** addresses. Now, IPv4 stands for **Internet Protocol Version 4**,  and IPv6 stands for **Internet Protocol Version 6**. So, once upon a time there were only IPv4 addresses.  Now, IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme  that allows for over 4 billion unique addresses.  But now that we've got computers, tablets,  game consoles, smart TVs, smartphones,  smart appliances, et cetera, now that we've got those  all connected to the Internet, and each device has to  have a unique IP address.  As a result, 4 billion IP addresses wasn't really enough,  and so IPv6 was born.  Now, it actually uses a 128-bit address scheme,  which allows for many, many more IP addresses  than IPv4 does.  Now, IPv4 addresses are written as four integers  separated by dots, and I'm sure you've seen that  probably before.  And IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal  and separated by colons.

Right now we're in a transition period, so when you ask for IP addresses,  you may see the IPv4 address returned,  or you may actually see the IPv6 address.

And while we're here, **IP** stands for **Internet Protocol**,  you may have heard the term TCP/IP.  This refers to using the TCP protocol with IP addresses, which doesn't necessarily mean the host is connected to the Internet.  Two applications running on the same host can use TCP/IP to communicate with each other.  When the client and server are on the same host,  usually the IP address, **127.0.0.1**,  which is also referred to as local host,  is used to identify the host.

Alright, so with that brief introduction to networking  terms out of the way, let's actually start our tour  of the java.net package.  So the package contains two sets of APIs.  Firstly, the low level API, and then the high level API.  Now when using the low level API,  you have to be more aware of networking concepts.  Still, when using Java to do network coding,  you're always working with abstractions  regardless of whether you're using the high  or low level API.

Java actually makes network coding much easier than it could have been, by letting developers write code using abstract concepts, and taking care of the implementation details under the hood.

Now because it's so common, we're going to use client/server examples in these networking videos in this section.  But you often want a reliable two-way communication link between the client and the server.  Now this is where the TCP protocol comes in.

Now TCP, which stands for **Transmission Control Protocol**,  establishes a two-way connection between hosts,  and this connection is reliable in the sense that the two hosts talk to each other.  When used with internet addresses,  you get TCP/IP, which uses the client/server model.

So, when communicating using TCPIP,  the sequence of events are as follows,

* firstly, the client opens a connection to the server,  
* secondly, the client sends a request to the server,  
* third, the server sends a response back to the client,
* and step four, the client closes the connection  to the server.

Now, steps two and three may be repeated multiple times before the connection's closed.

Now, when using the low-level networking API,  you'll use **sockets** to establish connections,  send requests, and receive responses.  Now a socket is one end-point of the two-way connection. The client will have a socket,  and the server will have a socket.  Now when you have multiple clients connecting to the same server, they'll use the same port,  but each client will have its own socket.

Now when you have multiple clients connecting to the same server, they'll use the same port number,  but each client will have its own socket.  Now, you'll use the **Socket** class for the client socket,  and the **ServerSocket** class for the server socket.

Now what's wonderful about Java is that all you have to do is provide the IP address and port when you create the socket.  You don't have to understand how TCP/IP works.  So underneath the covers, specific messages have to be sent to establish a connection between the client and the server(and this is a process that's called **handshaking**),  and the data has to be sent as **packets**,  which must be in a specific format.

But you don't have to take a course in computer networking when you write network code using Java,  and that's because it takes care of all these details under the covers.

Since we're talking about networking,  we're gonna have to write two applications to demonstrate how to do networking coding.  One application will be the server,  and the other will be the client.

Now the port number itself,  that I've allocated here, 5000  well that can be an integer  between zero and 65,535 inclusive.

Now some port numbers are already reserved or may already been used by other applications. The way to find out is to assign a port number and see if the socket instance is successfully created.
